# CS546_Letterboxd_Analyzer
Note: This repository is a fork of a collaborative group project. 
It reflects work I contributed to during development alongside my teammates.
## Features
### Core
- Users can upload their .zip file from Letterboxd to load their data
- Users can reupload their .zip file to update their data
- An admin account that allows the admin to add movies to the system, edit existing movies, and delete movies from the system.
- Letterboxd Wrapped would display movie statistics:
- Top genres
- Top directors
- Top actors
- Average movie rating
- Average difference between the user’s rating and global movie averages
- The number of hours spent watching movies
- Can calculate based on all-time data, the past year, or month.
- Recommendation based on top genres, directors, and actors
- Each time a user updates their data, it will save all of the movies watched during that period since the last update. It will serve as a time capsule for that period.
- Users can manually find movies from our database and input/update their rating data
- Commenting on the movie pages to interact with other users
- Integration with movie posters from Letterboxd.
- Allows users to follow other users
- Users have a public profile page where users can compare their statistics with other users (top movies, genres, hours spent watching).
